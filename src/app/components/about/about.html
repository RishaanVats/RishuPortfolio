    <div class="about-content">
      <p class="mb-3">
        I am a frontend engineer with experience supporting and stabilizing
        <strong>legacy production systems</strong> while contributing to the early development of
        <strong>enterprise-grade applications</strong>. My work has included full ownership of
        AngularJS systems in live environments, UI enhancement, issue resolution, and smooth
        coordination with backend and stakeholder teams.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        From 2022 to 2025, I dedicated time to preparing for the Competitive Civil Services Examination
        (UPSC). This period strengthened my discipline, analytical thinking, and structured approach to
        problem-solving—qualities that continue to shape the way I build and maintain software.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-0">
        Before transitioning fully into software, I held leadership roles managing teams and university
        initiatives, which helped develop clarity, communication, and ownership. These experiences continue
        to influence how I work today.

  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>

  <p class="aboutMain">
    I'm a Frontend Developer with around 3 years of experience at Wipro, where I worked on building responsive
    Angular-based applications and clean user interfaces as part of a MEAN stack environment. My work focused on
    delivering maintainable frontend code while supporting production systems.

    Over the past few years, I also engaged in rigorous competitive exam preparation, which strengthened my analytical
    thinking, discipline, and ability to break down complex problems. I am now transitioning back into frontend
    development, applying this structured mindset to building reliable and user-focused web applications.
  </p>

  <p class="aboutMain">
    I enjoy working on UI development, performance optimization, Bootstrap-based layouts, and gradually exploring AI/ML
    tools to broaden my technical perspective.
