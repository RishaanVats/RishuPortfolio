  <h2 class="fw-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>

  <p class="aboutMain">
    I’m a Frontend Developer with around 3 years of experience at Wipro, where I worked on building responsive
    Angular-based applications and clean user interfaces as part of a MEAN stack environment. My work focused on
    delivering maintainable frontend code while supporting production systems.

    Over the past few years, I also engaged in rigorous competitive exam preparation, which strengthened my analytical
    thinking, discipline, and ability to break down complex problems. I am now transitioning back into frontend
    development, applying this structured mindset to building reliable and user-focused web applications.
  </p>

  <p class="aboutMain">
    I enjoy working on UI development, performance optimization, Bootstrap-based layouts, and gradually exploring AI/ML
    tools to broaden my technical perspective.
