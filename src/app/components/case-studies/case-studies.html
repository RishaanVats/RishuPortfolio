      <h3 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-2">Context</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Worked on a <strong>business-critical legacy web application</strong> actively used in production.
        In parallel, a new enterprise-grade frontend was being planned and initially developed using
        <strong>Angular 6</strong>. I was part of the early development phase of this enterprise version.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Subsequently, based on client decision-making, the frontend technology for the enterprise
        application was migrated from Angular 6 to <strong>React</strong>. Following this shift, I transitioned
        into <strong>full ownership and solo support of the legacy application</strong>, ensuring continuity and
        stability during the broader system transition.

        This experience strengthened my ability to work across multiple frontend frameworks, adapt to
        architectural changes driven by business requirements, and take <strong>end-to-end responsibility</strong> for
        maintaining and stabilizing legacy systems in production. It also reinforced the importance of
        continuous learning and flexibility in modern frontend development.
