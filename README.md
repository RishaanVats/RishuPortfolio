This repository contains my personal portfolio website built using Angular and Bootstrap. The project showcases selected frontend projects, case studies, and technical experience, with a focus on clean UI, performance, and production-ready architecture.

## Tech Stack
- Angular
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Integrations & Services
- Firebase Hosting (deployment)
- Firebase Firestore (contact message storage)
- EmailJS (email notifications from contact form)

## Key Features
- Component-based architecture
- Angular routing with lazy-loaded modules
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layouts
- Secure environment-based configuration
- Optimized production builds

## Architecture Overview
The application follows a modular Angular architecture with clearly separated UI components, services, and routing layers, designed for maintainability and scalability.

## Security & Best Practices
- Environment variables for third-party keys
- No secrets committed to source control
- Firestore protected via security rules

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
